* Two random C++ implementation

I didn't want to make a seperate repository for these two code.

* Tree driver
For the Operating system coursework, we had to implement a userspace driver to implement the 'tree' command for inf-os. A Operating system used for teaching the course in University of Edinburgh.

The challenge was not being able to use malloc, so the implementation was tricky use of static memory.

* Branch Predictor
Implementing different branch predictor for the computer architecture course.
